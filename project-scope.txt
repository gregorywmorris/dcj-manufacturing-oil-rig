Background

The data set comes from a real hydraulic rig system. This hydraulic rig is used to drill oil out of the ground. It has 4 main controls: the cooler setting, 
the valve setting, the pump setting, and the accumulator setting. The rig has sensors in different areas measuring the pressure, volumetric flows, and temperatures.



Oil wells can make $500,000+ / day, so these machines are highly valuable. Making sure we run them with data will be huge for our company.

Avery will be focusing on being the data analyst task this month.



The original data set is from UCI Machine Learning Repository
